/**
 * The people at the Hoover Dam have called you back, and would like a program that
 * shows what happens when only the even numbered turbines are turned on.
 * And they want it all in just one for loop. With a set of complex conditional statements inside
 * the loop, construct a way to only turn on even numbered turbines. Remember our power output situation:
 * Generators 1 through 4 produce 62 MW.
 * Generators 5 through 19 produce 124 MW.
 * The output should follow this format:
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Generator #1 is off.
 * Generator #2 is on, adding 62 MW, for a total of 62 MW!
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * We’ve given you some starting variables to use in your build.
 * Within your loop, consider the possible scenarios when building your conditions:
 * The Generator provides 62 MW of power.
 * The Generator provides 124 MW of power.
 * The Generator is off.
